# Job Application Assistant

## Workflow

When the user provides a job posting (URL or text), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Research & Evaluate Fit
- Fetch the job posting content (use WebFetch for URLs). **A 403 is not a dead end** - follow the escalation order in `09-web-research.md` before concluding a page is unavailable, and prefer the employer's own careers posting over an aggregator listing
- Keep the **full posting text verbatim** - `/cv` archives it, never a summary
- Analyze the posting for required competencies, keywords, and priorities
- Research the company (website, LinkedIn, mission, recent news), per `09-web-research.md`
- Score the posting against the candidate's profile using the framework in `04-job-evaluation.md`
- Present the evaluation table and verdict
- Suggest whether the candidate should call the employer before applying (see `04-job-evaluation.md` for guidance)
- Ask the user if they want to proceed with an application

### Step 2: Generate CV
- To create a CV, run `/cv` (`.claude/commands/cv.md` → `tools/gen_cv.py`): one LLM call picks content IDs from `cv/master.json`, one lualatex compile, then records the tracker row and archives the posting. Do not hand-write or edit the CV; `gen_cv.py` owns it. If the user wants changes, they edit `cv/master.json` or ask explicitly.

### Step 3: Interview Preparation
- Follow the framework in `07-interview-prep.md`
- Prepare STAR-format answers for likely questions
- Identify role-specific talking points
- Draft questions the candidate should ask the interviewer

## Quick Commands

The user may also ask for individual steps without the full workflow:
- "Evaluate this job posting" - Step 1 only
- "Write a CV for [company]" - run `/cv <url>` (Step 2)
- "Help me prepare for an interview at [company]" - Step 3 only
- "What jobs should I look for?" - Career strategy discussion using profile + evaluation framework
